===================

This bundle is used to manage editorial content in a website.

This is a stable version.

Why this CMS ?
==============
We are developping this CMS because the opensource CMS we found on the market were
too complex for our clients.

The goals of this CMS are :

* a super easy to use CMS for non technical people
* a CMS that can be integrated in an existing symfony2 project
* editorial contents managed by the CMS can be added to a dynamic page
* no administration page exept the website tree.

State of the project
====================
In production state.

* a lot of documentation is missing
* no unit test
* only works on unix/linux hosting

We are are using this CMS at Kitpages for websites.

Features
========
* Edition of contents
* edition/preview/production mode
* change page layout and block template freely
* upload images
* can be integrated as a simple bundle in an existing website
* manage navigation
* small news/blog system integrated

Installation
============
* documentations are very light for the moment. The better is to use the Kitpages CMS symfony distribution :
https://github.com/kitpages/symfony-kitpages-cms-edition to install the CMS.
