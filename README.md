Why this CMS ?
==============
We are developping this CMS because the opensource CMS we found on the market were
too complex for our clients.

The goals of this CMS are :
* a super easy to use CMS for non technical people
* a CMS that can be integrated in an existing symfony2 project
* editorial contents managed by the CMS can be added to a dynamic page
* no administration page exept the website tree.

State of the project
====================
In beta state.
- a lot of documentation is missing
- no unit test
- only works on unix/linux hosting

But we already use it for some client websites
